flow: 

if tenant input is in billing table then i should not be able to select them in billing 
statement, i need to have a checker if the tenant roomnumber/tenid is present in the table 
of billing_table. 

if the tenant paid the bill then it will disappear in the billing_table so then i will
now be able to select the tenants room again for the next billing period
